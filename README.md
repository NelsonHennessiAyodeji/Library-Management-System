Please note that there will be a 30 - 60 seconds delay at first,but after then, you should be good. This happens because of the free tier on render, which is where I upload most of my projects on.

(This project is far from complete, so you might experience some little bugs or uncompleted pages here and there)

## Tech Stack:
### Frontend
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

### Backend

Developer's Note: This has to be one of my first project ever, using it now, it is quite buggy, but regardless, it does what its supposed to do. I'm not a frontend developer, so please dont mind the UI.
